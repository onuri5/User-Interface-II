        <p>Hello... my name is John Barnett and I am excited to share with you all that I have learned over the past week.<br/>
        So far my class and I have covered some of the basic fundamentals of web design; like your basic html tags, all the way to today, where we went in depth into Flexbox<br/>
        This webpage is my fourth project that I have completed since starting at the Lambda School.</p>
